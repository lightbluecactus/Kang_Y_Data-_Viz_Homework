					Looking into the data of previous Winter Olympics, we could learn a lot of interesting information. This page shows a comparision between the top two winners of total medals amount - Canada and US, analizes data from three different angles and provides charts to visualize the information. To simplify the data, years selected begins from the 1990s, which includes Winter Olympics on 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014.

					The two charts show features of data from Canada and the United States clearly. Similarly, medals won by the two countries both start to grow rapidly from 1998. For Canada, the most outstanding feature is the large amount of golden medals. Although American won even more medals than Canada, their silver medals takes the most proportion. After all, winning a medal is the proof of strength.

					From the bar charts, we could tell that Canadian athlets are very professional at ice hockey, and they have won over 200 medals in total! Compared to Canadians, Americans are also good at ice hockey, but they falls behind about 60 medals. Another sport that is the advantage of athlets from both countries is skating, and the amount of medals are both above 100 in total.

				<p>
					Medals won by male and female athlets have more apparent differences in the two countries. In Canada, the achievement of males and females is overall balanced, with a nearly same number of gold medals, and male and female athlets outperforming each other in silver and bronze medals. In America, female athletes have obviously won more medals than male, with an amazing higher number in gold medals.
